## New Vimar Devices

I can only support and test those devices I have currently in my installation. 
If you want to use new devices I need to know which attributes this device have and what they mean.
See below a short video of how I currently check for those attributes:

### Read out attributes

The Webserver will update the status of all devices currently shown on screen regulary.
We are trying to monitor that communication to see how that device is used internally.

1. open up the vimar webserver
2. press F12 / Ctrl+Shift+i to open the Webdeveloper tools
3. switch to the Network tab and make sure the record button (red dot) is active
4. open a page on the webserver where (preferable only) that device is shown
5. clear the network tab and wait for the next status update from the webserver
6. select one of the requests and switch to the "preview" or the "response" tab
7. check if the given response includes "familiar" values for the device you try to add 

    > e.g. the climate should include the current temperature. It's possible that additional status updates are sent along regulary from the webserver. If unsure, check and compare several requests

8. copy that response text and insert it into a new ticket
9. if possible try to explain the values as well. This works best if you switch any state of the device and check how the attributes adapt.

    > e.g. `temperatura` is the current temperature, `stagione` is 1 for cooling and 0 for heating etc.)



> this was done in the chrome browser - name of tabs and shortcuts may be different in other browsers but usually all modern browsers should support this


### Set attributes

coming soon.


## Home Assistant / HACS Support

Anything you can ;)

Currently looking for someone to explain/implement `config_flow.py` or `reproduce_state.py` and to help me get the integration into [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/).
