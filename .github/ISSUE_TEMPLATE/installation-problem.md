**Describe the problem**
Please provide the part of the home-assistant.log that does not fit you well.

**Check for some things first**
<!-- Please check if you can fix the issue on your own -->
- [ ] the source code of the integration is cloned into the directory: `config/custom_components/vimar_platform`
- [ ] the `config/` directory above (can be named differently) but it should hold the general `configuration.yaml` and the `home-assistant.log` file
- [ ] the tips listed under [troubleshooting](https://github.com/h4de5/home-assistant-vimar#troubleshooting) did not help me with my issue.

**Setup**
 - Environment: [e.g. raspberryPi, macos, virtualenv, docker]
 - Home-Assistant Version: [e.g. v0.110.3]
