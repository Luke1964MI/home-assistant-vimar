**Describe the problem**

<!-- Please provide the part of the home-assistant.log that does not fit you well. -->

**Check for some things first**

<!-- Please check if you can fix the issue on your own -->

- [ ] the source code of the integration is cloned into the right directory: `config/custom_components/vimar`
- [ ] the `config/` directory above (can be named differently) but it should hold the general `configuration.yaml` and the `home-assistant.log` file
- [ ] the tips listed under [troubleshooting](https://github.com/h4de5/home-assistant-vimar#troubleshooting) did not help me with my issue.
- [ ] I updated to the most recent version of this integration
- [ ] I checked existing issues, that may have the same issue

**Setup**

<!-- Please give me some more insights about your setup -->

- Home-Assistant Version: [e.g. v0.110.3, 2021.5.1]
